### **DESCRIPTION**
This is a C++ implmentation of a board game. This game allows board customization i.e., the user can enter in the dimensions of the board. There is a start and an end point to which the user must reach without hitting one of the traps otherwise the user loses. The board game also has bounds set up i.e., the user cannot move out of the board.
